## This is a markdown file

*Example code below was left to show Rmarkdown's ability to display code and text*



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
print("Hello Data Scientists")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
